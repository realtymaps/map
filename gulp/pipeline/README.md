pipeline
========
This is to be used if webpack is not sufficient.

The basic premise is to take a list of scripts or style sheets and pump
them to gulp. The saveJSON feature is so the pipeline can be saved with all of its
matching files in the correct order.

Once a (pure matched) pipeline is saved it can easily be injected into an html file.
To have easy mapping and debugging.
