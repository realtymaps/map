# This file follows the general format of .gitignore rules (allowing wildcards like *.log), except that not-rules
# (starting with !) don't work here.  The intent is to indicate files that are in VCS, but are unneeded for the build
# and/or the runtime app; they're removed BEFORE the buildpacks are run automatically by heroku.  (This helps reduce
# slug size and speeds up deploy.)

# To indicate files needed for the build but not for the runtime app, see .slugclean
