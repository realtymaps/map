  PLEASE NOTE!

  For the majority of client side request $http should be used. Only use this if
  angular does not meet your needs and you need minimum security and browser support.

  using callback to not pull in bluebird, if you really want promises then pull in Q or use native (es6)promises

  Big differences:
  - little to no security measures (allow cross origin)
  - defaults to synchronous
  - no cache

# Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
# ----------------------------------------
# Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
# results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
# URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
# Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
# properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
# compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See
# http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
#
# Implementation Notes for IE
# ---------------------------
# IE >= 8 and <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
# browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
# them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
# work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
# URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
# properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.
#
# IE7 does not normalize the URL when assigned to an anchor node.  (Apparently, it does, if one
# uses the inner HTML approach to assign the URL as part of an HTML snippet -
# http://stackoverflow.com/a/472729)  However, setting img[src] does normalize the URL.
# Unfortunately, setting img[src] to something like "javascript:foo" on IE throws an exception.
# Since the primary usage for normalizing URLs is to sanitize such URLs, we can't use that
# method and IE < 8 is unsupported.
