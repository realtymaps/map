#hidden by Leaflet
_pointToGeoJSON = L.Circle::toGeoJSON
###
All of the below L.Circle extensions spawn from the fact that the GeoJSON spec does
not support circles. One should note that PostGIS does not either except in aproximations.

Therefore in doing GIS queries we will need to aproximate the circle as a polygon.

To be honest L.GeoJSON does a shoddy job at creating layers from existing geojson data
