# rlm-icons

[Icomoon](http://icomoon.io) is what is used to manage and add icons to the rlm-icons set. This process should be documented
here.

## Do I need to exist?
In general all icons should be derrived from font-awesome unless there is something that is specific that can not be satisified
by fontawesome. Therefore this should be used and added to seldom.
