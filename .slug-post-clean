# This file follows the format of rm parameters (allowing wildcards like *.log).  The intent is to indicate files that
# are used for the build, but are unneeded by the runtime; they're removed at the end of the build process by our
# buildpack at https://github.com/realtymaps/heroku-buildpack-post-build-clean  (This helps reduce slug size and speeds
# up deploy.)

# To indicate files needed for the build but not for the runtime app, see .slugclean
